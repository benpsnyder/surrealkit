# effect-surrealkit

[Effect](https://effect.website) v4 schemas for SurrealDB values exactly as
the JavaScript SDK (`surrealdb` 2.x) decodes and encodes them.

```sh
npm i effect-surrealkit effect@4.0.6 surrealdb@2.1.1
```

Every schema imports only `effect` and `surrealdb` value classes, so it runs
in browsers, Workers, Bun and Node.

## Two codec worlds

The default exports describe **native** values: what the SDK hands back after
CBOR decoding (`DateTime`, `Decimal`, `RecordId`, `Set`, …) and accepts for
bound variables. Decode a query result with them; encode bindings with them.

Ordinary SurrealDB **JSON** (`/sql` over HTTP, JSON exports) is lossy — NONE
and NULL collapse, decimals become strings, sets become arrays, record ids
become text, ints beyond `±(2^53 - 1)` cannot survive `JSON.parse`. Codecs for
that representation are named `<Name>FromJson` (with `<Name>JsonEncoded`
types) and are never the default.

```ts
import { Schema } from 'effect';
import * as SurrealSchema from 'effect-surrealkit';

const Person = SurrealSchema.NoneAsAbsent(
  Schema.Struct({
    id: SurrealSchema.RecordIdFor('person'),
    name: SurrealSchema.String,
    nickname: Schema.optionalKey(SurrealSchema.String),
    born: SurrealSchema.DateTime,
    balance: SurrealSchema.Decimal,
    tags: SurrealSchema.SetOf(SurrealSchema.String),
  }),
);

const [rows] = await db.query<[unknown[]]>('SELECT * FROM person');
const people = rows.map(Schema.decodeUnknownSync(Person));
```

## Values

| SurrealQL | Schema | Decoded type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `Int` (`int: "safe-number"`, default) / `Int64` (`int: "bigint"`) | `number` / branded `bigint` |
| `float` | `Schema.Number` | `number` |
| `decimal` | `Decimal` | SDK `Decimal` |
| `number` | `SurrealNumber` | `number \| bigint \| Decimal` |
| `string` | `String` | `string` (well-formed Unicode) |
| `datetime` | `DateTime` (`datetime: "sdk"`, default) / `DateTimeEffect` | SDK `DateTime` / Effect `DateTime.Utc` |
| `duration` | `Duration` | SDK `Duration` |
| `uuid` | `Uuid` | SDK `Uuid` |
| `bytes` | `Bytes` | `Uint8Array` |
| `record<t>` | `RecordIdFor("t", { key? })` | `RecordId<"t">` |
| `record` | `RecordIdAny` | `RecordId` |
| `record<a \| b>` | a union of `RecordIdFor`s; `taggedRecordId({ a, b })` for `{ _tag, id }` | |
| `table<a \| b>` | `TableFor(["a", "b"])` | `Table<"a" \| "b">` |
| `file<bucket>` | `FileRefFor(["bucket"])` | SDK `FileRef` |
| `geometry<…>` | `GeometryOf([...])`, `GeometryPoint`, … | SDK geometry classes |
| `range` | `Range` | SDK `Range` |
| `set<T, N>` | `SetOf(T, { length?, equality? })` | `ReadonlySet<T>` |
| literals | `Schema.Literal`, `DecimalLiteral`, `DurationLiteral`, `Int64Literal` | |
| `regex`, `function` | `Unsupported(kind)` | `never` |

`NoneAsAbsent(schema)` removes properties whose value is `undefined` (how the
SDK surfaces NONE) before decoding, so exact `Schema.optionalKey` fields work
on projections and object values; `null` is kept.

Every schema carries `toCode` metadata, so
`SchemaRepresentation.toCodeDocument` prints a schema built from them back to
source.

## What the codecs refuse, and why

Measured against SurrealDB 3.2.4 and 3.3.0 with surrealdb.js 2.1.1. Each of
these is a silent corruption or a hang without the check:

- **Integers.** The SDK decodes an `int` as a `number` up to `2^53` and as a
  `bigint` beyond, except that `-(2^53 + 1)` arrives as the number `-2^53`
  (already rounded). `Int` fails beyond `±(2^53 - 1)`; `Int64` accepts only
  exactly representable numbers, so `-2^53` fails as ambiguous. A bigint
  outside int64 is refused before sending: the server wraps it
  (`2^63` is stored as `-2^63`).
- **Decimals** are limited to a 96-bit mantissa and 28 fractional digits.
  A larger mantissa makes the server answer with an error the SDK never
  resolves (the query hangs); extra fractional digits are rounded away.
  The SDK's string constructor is permissive (`new Decimal("abc")` is zero,
  `new Decimal("+1.5")` is 0.5), so `decimalFromString` never uses it: it
  parses sign, digits and exponent itself and builds the value from integers.
- **Datetimes** outside `-262143-01-01 … +262142-12-31` hang the query the same
  way. The SDK formats pre-1970 datetimes with fractional seconds one second
  late, so `DateTimeFromJson` uses its own RFC 3339 parser and formatter.
- **Durations** cannot be negative; the SDK silently sends a negative
  `Duration` as `0ns`.
- **Strings** with a lone UTF-16 surrogate cannot be stored in UTF-8; the CBOR
  encoder would replace it with U+FFFD.
- **Sets** are only sent deduplicated (under SurrealDB value equality) and of
  their exact declared length: SurrealDB 3.3.0 aborts the server on a
  duplicate-bearing write to an `option<set<T, N>>` field.
- **Bytes** arrive as an `ArrayBuffer`; `Bytes` normalises them to
  `Uint8Array`.
- Configure the SDK with its default `useNativeDates: false`; `DateTime`
  rejects JS `Date`s, which lose nanoseconds.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

The property suites round-trip every codec through the SDK's CBOR codec in
process (`Arbitrary.schema` + `Arbitrary.checkEffect`). The engine suite
repeats them through a real, disposable server; it runs when one of these is
set, and is skipped (with a notice) otherwise:

```sh
SURREAL_BIN=/usr/local/bin/surreal bun run test          # starts `surreal start … memory`
SURREAL_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc bun run test         # a throwaway container, root/root
```
